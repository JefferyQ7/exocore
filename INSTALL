                -- Installation --

Building works through the Waf build system. You can obtain Waf from:
http://code.google.com/p/waf

Once installed, you must configure the project like so:

    $ waf configure

The ExoCore Waf script also supports some additional options:

    * --mode (= "debug")
      - Which mode to build in. Building in "debug" disables any and
        all optimizations, while "release" enables optimization and
        inlining.

With the project configured, you can execute a build by doing:

    $ waf build

You can optionally build the documentation:

    $ waf docs

The documentation will be placed in 'docs/_build'. You'll probably
be interested in 'docs/_build/html/index.html' primarily.
