            == ExoCore Operating System Kernel ==

                -- Introduction --

ExoCore is an operating system kernel written in the C programming language
(C11 with GNU extensions, specifically meant to be built with Clang). It is
a so-called exokernel; it only provides the bare minimum of abstraction needed
around the hardware. This allows for most aspects of real operating systems to
be implemented in user space.

ExoCore is primarily a reference project. It is not intended to be a kernel
for real world usage; rather, to be a learning project for the developers and
anyone else interested in kernel development.
